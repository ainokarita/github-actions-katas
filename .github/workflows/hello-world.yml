#A line-by-line explanation of the above:

#Line 1: The name attribute provides useful organizational information when returning warnings, errors, and output. The name should be meaningful to you as an action within your build process.
#Line 2: The on is the name of the GitHub event that triggers the workflow.
#Line 3: The jobs level contains a collection of jobs that make up the workflow.
#ine 4-5: The my-job is an example of the name for a job, runs-on describes on which operating system the pipeline should run.
#ine 6-8: The steps collection is an ordered list of run directives. Each run directive is executed in the order in which it is declared.
